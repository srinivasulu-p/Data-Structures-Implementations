# Data-Structures-Implementations
Own implementation of Data Structures in Java.

In Each of the Data Structure Implementation, you can see the functions related to those data structures.

Details of methods implemented in each of the data structures implemented

1. LinkedList file contains following methods
      1. add(E newElement)            --- add element at end to list
		  2. add(int index, E newElement) --- polymorphism for add method is seen here.
		  3. get(int index)               --- retieve specific index element from list
		  4. delete(int index)            --- delete specific index element from list
		  5. size()                       --- return current size(no.of elements) in the list
		  6. isEmpty()                    --- return whether Linkedlist is empty or not
		  7. clear()                      --- clear the LinkedList
		  8. print()                      --- print elements from head to tail
		  9. printRec()                   --- Recursively printing elements from head to tail
	   10. printRevRec()                --- Recursively printing elements from tail to head
	   11. reverse()                    --- reverse the elements in LinkedList
	   12. reverseRec()                 --- Recursively reversing the elements in LinkedList
	   13. reverseUsingStack()          --- Reversing the elements in LinkedList using stack
